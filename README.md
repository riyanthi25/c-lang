# My new journey learning C languange
Here is my small project for the very first time using C language.
# How to run the project?
1. Make sure you have installed Developer command prompt
2. If you don't have installed, i suggest you to read carefully from the Microsoft documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022
3. Open your Developer Command Prompt
4. Change the directory where you have saved your `.c` files 
5. Run this command for compiling the file `cl main.c`  (for example) adjust it to your file name
6. Then run this command to run your compiled file `main.exe` 
7. Done!!!
